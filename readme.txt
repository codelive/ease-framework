== Description ==
 
The Cloudward EASE framework is an HTML-like, markup language that allows you to:

Create complex and beautifully designed web apps.
Access Google Drive, Amazon S3 and your WordPress Database.
With EASE, you can easily set up your website, customize it, and integrate with Google and Sheets. EASE is also open-source and can grow with your business.

EASE is easy to install and customize, and it provides a strong, flexible foundation to build your business on.

Tags: You just put EASE tags into your forms and the EASE framework will set up your database for you.

Forms: EASE forms look like regular HTML forms, but the EASE framework tells your database what to do or Google Sheets where to save the data.

Lists: EASE lists get the data out of your database or a Google Sheet and print it on the page.

Functions: EASE functions manage if-then logic, system utilities, cookies, authorization, file management, and more complicated functions when you need them. Plus the EASE library of functions continues to grow.

= What are the Limitations? =
The EASE Framework connects to your local database. If your hosting provider locks down your local database, then some functions may not operate (you can turn off database access in plugin settings), Also, the EASE Framework connects to Google Drive via Oauth. While we strive to make this work with as many hosting providers as possible, If your hosting provider locks down some settings access to Google Drive may be limited.
